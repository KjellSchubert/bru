# I added this script mostly because I wanted to use modularized boost
# libs (so I don't have to pull in & compile boost-serialization just because 
# I want to use boost-regex), and because modularized boost doesn't make
# it obvious which boost module depends on which other boost module.
#
# There are two kinds of deps to consider here:
# a) deps due to public #include files of a module: e.g. when I want to 
#    #include boost-regex I have to have boost-config in the Include search
#    path because boost/regex/something.h does #include boost/config/foo.h.
# b) private deps: if a boost-regex *.cpp file #includes boost/thingy/foo.h
#    (but public #includes dont) then downstream consumers of boost-regex
#    don't need boost/thingy in their #include path. They still need to
#    link against boost/thingy though (unless boost/thingy was a header-only
#    library, many boost libs are).
#
# Not sure what the best name for these 2 kinds of deps would be: e.g. 'public'
# vs 'private' module deps? These public deps should be avoided if possible,
# e.g. via pimpl idiom. Only the linker which needs to link the final executable
# will need to accumulate all private deps across the whole dependency tree
# (and can ignore header-only deps).
#
# Dont connfuse a&b with nodejs:npm-style dev-dependencies, which are deps for
# building an individual module or its resources.
#
# WARNING: finding the exact set of needed #includes is difficult due to
# c preprocessor: some #includes may be #ifdef'ed out in some configs. This
# tool here is supposed to find the worst-case, potentially overestimated
# set of deps.
