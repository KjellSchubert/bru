    # Creating a *.gyp file for building openssl is possible but tedious
    # work. Instead let's build via configure/make. Note that a *.gyp file
    # is still used to declare openssl's include_dirs and library artifacts
    # for downstream clients.
    # P.S.: I created this gyp file after all since using the regular nmake
    # based build on Windows turned into a mess: nmake (probably) ended up
    # using a different toolchain than gyp used downstream, resulting in the
    # corresponding linker errors. So now on we only run ./configure here and
    # compile with gyp. WARNING: the gyp file will not necessarily end up using
    # the same options ./configure had configured. TODO: revisit this process.
